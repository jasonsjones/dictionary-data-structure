# Simple Data Cache

## Description

This is a javascript implementation of a
[dictionary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)
data structure that represents a very simple, but effective, data cache.

*For specific examples and documentation, see the below sections*

#### Environment:

Although this implementation is designed to be used with
[Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), it could be used in other contexts with minor
modifications.  This implementation does not have any external dependencies
that would preclude it from being used in the browser--just include it with a
`<script>` tag and it should be good to go.  _Disclaimer: I have not tested
this implementation in any other context/environment; only tested with node.js_

## Basic Usage

Basic usage example below.  _Note: it does not cover all the available
methods, rather just highlights the main functionality to get up and running
with this data structure. For a description of all the methods, see the
API section._
